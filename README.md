# Tech-3 Technical Demo (JetBrains: PyCharm)

This is a self-contained demo intended to showcase features of PyCharm.

## Expectations

- less than 10 commits
- less than 20 files
- and some intentionally broken code that doesn't break running the app but that showcases how PyCharm can help you redress such things

## Documentation

Feel free to check out the [JetBrains quick-start guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/quick-start-guide.html) for setup help.

Likewise, there is [documentation for the PyCharm features](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/feature-trainer.html) in case you wanted a deeper cut.

Additionally, in case you are a developer polyglot, [this page](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/supported-languages.html) should help you identify what languages are available without a PyCharm Pro license.

(And, as of 22 October 2025, [this page](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows) indicates that users simply start with PyCharm Pro for a month)
